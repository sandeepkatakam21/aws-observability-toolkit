## Example Directories

### `/cloudwatch-scripts`
Contains CloudWatch-related automation scripts, dashboard templates, and alarm configurations for various AWS services.

### `/opensearch-dashboards`
Pre-built OpenSearch dashboards for monitoring AWS services, including visualization templates and index patterns.

### `/datadog-integration`

### `/prometheus-alerts`
Prometheus alerting rules, recording rules, and configuration files for monitoring AWS resources.

## Sample Usage

### Monitoring EC2 Instances

```bash
# Deploy CloudWatch monitoring for EC2
./cloudwatch-scripts/setup-ec2-monitoring.sh

# Set up Datadog agent on EC2
./datadog-integration/install-datadog-ec2.sh

# Configure Prometheus Node Exporter
./prometheus-alerts/setup-node-exporter.sh
```

### Monitoring AWS Lambda Functions

```bash
# Enable CloudWatch Insights for Lambda
./cloudwatch-scripts/lambda-insights-setup.sh

# Configure Datadog Lambda monitoring
./datadog-integration/lambda-monitoring-setup.sh

# Set up custom Prometheus metrics for Lambda
./prometheus-alerts/lambda-metrics-config.yaml
```

### Monitoring Amazon RDS

```bash
# Deploy RDS CloudWatch dashboards
./cloudwatch-scripts/rds-dashboard-template.json

# Configure OpenSearch for RDS log analysis
./opensearch-dashboards/rds-logs-dashboard.json

# Set up Datadog RDS monitoring
./datadog-integration/rds-monitoring.yaml

# Configure Prometheus RDS Exporter
./prometheus-alerts/rds-exporter-config.yml
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Python 3.8+ (for script execution)
- Docker (for containerized monitoring tools)
- Access to your chosen monitoring platform (Datadog, Prometheus, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sandeepkatakam21/aws-observability-toolkit.git
   cd aws-observability-toolkit
   ```

2. **Configure AWS credentials:**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. **Choose your monitoring stack:**
   - For CloudWatch: Navigate to `./cloudwatch-scripts/`
   - For OpenSearch: Navigate to `./opensearch-dashboards/`
   - For Datadog: Navigate to `./datadog-integration/`
   - For Prometheus: Navigate to `./prometheus-alerts/`

4. **Follow the specific setup instructions in each directory's README.**

### Quick Start

```bash
# Make scripts executable
find . -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;

# Run the setup wizard (coming soon)
./setup-wizard.sh
```

## Configuration

Each monitoring tool has its own configuration requirements:

- **CloudWatch**: Requires appropriate IAM permissions for metric access
- **OpenSearch**: Requires OpenSearch cluster endpoint and authentication
- **Datadog**: Requires Datadog API key and application key
- **Prometheus**: Requires Prometheus server configuration

Refer to each directory's documentation for detailed configuration steps.
